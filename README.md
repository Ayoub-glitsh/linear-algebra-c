# 📊 Matrix Operations in C

## 📝 Description

This project is a **C program** designed to practice fundamental programming concepts such as:
- Multidimensional arrays (matrices)
- Loops and conditional statements
- User input/output
- Basic mathematical operations on matrices

The program allows the user to manipulate two matrices and perform several operations on them.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔢 Input of two matrices **A** and **B** of size `L x C`
- ➕ Matrix addition: `S = A + B`
- ➖ Matrix subtraction: `D = A - B`
- ✖️ Scalar multiplication of matrix **A** by a real number `k`
- 📈 Calculation of the total sum of elements for matrices **A**, **B**, **S**, and **D**
- 🏆 Identification and display of the matrix with the **largest total sum**

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Language:** C
- **Libraries:**  
  - `stdio.h`  
  - `stdlib.h`

---

## ▶️ How to Compile and Run

### Compile
```bash
gcc main.c -o matrix_operations
```

### Run
```bash
./matrix_operations
```

---

## 📌 How the Program Works

1. The user enters the number of rows (`L`) and columns (`C`)
2. The user fills matrices **A** and **B**
3. The program displays both matrices
4. It computes and displays:
   - Sum matrix `S`
   - Difference matrix `D`
5. The user enters a real number `k` to multiply matrix **A**
6. The program calculates the total sum of elements of all matrices
7. The matrix with the **maximum sum** is displayed
